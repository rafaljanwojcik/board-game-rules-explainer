Welcome to the Board Game Rules Explainer Github repository. This was a group project for the [Full Stack Deep Learning 2022 Course](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/). 

We are a team of four members: [Rafa≈Ç](https://github.com/rafaljanwojcik), [Tim](https://github.com/timjones1), [Issam](https://github.com/quig) & [Muriel](https://github.com/murielhol)

The aim of this project was to build and deploy a Question Answering system to reduce the amount of time players spend reading and checking the rulebook while playing board games. 

This repository was forked from the main [Haystack repository](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) which is awesome.
